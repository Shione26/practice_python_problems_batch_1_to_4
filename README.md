# Practice Python Problems: Batch 1 to 4

This repository contains my solutions to a series of Python programming exercises. The problems are categorized into four batches.

---

## Batch 1 - Arithmetic Operations and Looping

1. **Prog01:** Input 2 numbers and print the bigger number.
2. **Prog02:** Input 2 numbers and print "Equal" if the numbers are the same.
3. **Prog03:** Input 2 numbers and print their sum.
4. **Prog04:** Input 2 numbers and print their product.
5. **Prog05:** Input 2 numbers and print their quotient (with decimal points).
6. **Prog06:** Input 2 numbers and print the result of the first number raised to the second.
7. **Prog07:** Input 10 numbers and print their sum.
8. **Prog08:** Input 10 numbers and count how many are odd.
9. **Prog09:** Print all even numbers from 0 to 100 using a `for` loop.
10. **Prog10:** Print all numbers from 0 to 100 except those ending in zero.

## Batch 2 - More Conditions and Looping

1. **Prog01:** Input 2 numbers and print the smaller number.
2. **Prog02:** Input 2 numbers and print "Not Equal" if the numbers are different.
3. **Prog03:** Input 2 numbers and print their difference.
4. **Prog04:** Input 2 numbers and print their quotient (without decimal points).
5. **Prog05:** Input 2 numbers and print the remainder when dividing the first by the second.
6. **Prog06:** Input 10 numbers and compute the result of subtracting the subsequent numbers from the first.
7. **Prog07:** Input 10 numbers and count how many are even.
8. **Prog08:** Print all odd numbers from 0 to 100 using a `while` loop.
9. **Prog09:** Print all numbers from 0 to 100 except those ending in zero or five.
10. **Prog10:** Input 2 numbers and print all numbers between them.

## Batch 3 - Lists and Sets

1. **Prog01:** Input 10 numbers and display those without duplicates.
2. **Prog02:** Input 10 numbers and display all, showing only the first entry for duplicates.
3. **Prog03:** Continuously input numbers until invalid input, displaying "Unique" or "Duplicate" based on the number.
4. **Prog04:** Continuously input numbers until invalid input, displaying the lowest number.
5. **Prog05:** Continuously input numbers until invalid input, displaying numbers sorted from lowest to highest.

## Batch 4 - Advanced List Operations

1. **Prog01:** Input 10 numbers and display those with duplicates.
2. **Prog02:** Continuously input numbers until invalid input, displaying the number with the most duplicates.
3. **Prog03:** Continuously input numbers until invalid input, displaying the highest number.
4. **Prog04:** Continuously input numbers until invalid input, displaying numbers sorted from highest to lowest.
5. **Prog05:** Continuously input numbers until invalid input, displaying their average.

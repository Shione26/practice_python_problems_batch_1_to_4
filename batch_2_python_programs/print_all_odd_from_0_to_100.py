# Prog08: Create a program that print all the odd numbers starting from 0 to 100. (Use while loop)

# print 0 to 100 using while loop
    #initialize variable
num = 1 

while num < 101:   # loop until less than 101
    print(num)     # print output
    num += 2       # increases number by 2 to get the next odd number

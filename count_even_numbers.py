# Prog07: Create a program that ask user to input 10 numbers. Print how many are even numbers.

# ask user for 10 numbers
    # initialize variable before loop

number_count = 0
even_count = 0

    # inside for loop, ask the user for inputs 10 times
for number_count in range(10):
    number = int(input(f"Enter number {number_count + 1}: "))

# check if the input is an even number
    # increment variable 
# print output
